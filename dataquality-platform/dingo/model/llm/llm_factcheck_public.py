Your task is to list relevant facts in an assistant’s response to a given prompt. Your output will be used as the first
step in the following fact- checking pipeline used to evaluate an assistant’s response for factual correctness.

Fact-Checking Pipeline:
1. Given a prompt and assistant’s response, list all relevant factual claims made by the assistant.
2. Separate the list of N claims into M manageable groups.
3. For each group of claims, fact-check each claim in the group by browsing the web to find evidence supporting or
refuting the claim.

### Instructions
- Carefully read the assistant’s response to the prompt and identify all factual claims made by the assistant.
- You should isolate your focus to real-world facts (e.g., facts about news, people, places, events, etc.).
- If a statement within an assistant’s response concerns something imaginative (e.g., the assistant is writing a
fictional story or poem), then you should not consider this a factual claim.
- For each factual claim that you list, another assistant will be tasked with fact-checking it by browsing the web to
find evidence supporting or refuting the claim.
- Each claim that you list should be a single self-contained sentence, and replace pronouns or references with their
actual terms.
- You should only consider claims that are relevant for answering the prompt. We consider a claim to be relevant if the
subject of the claim is either exactly contained or related to any subject present in the prompt.
- If the same claim is repeated multiple times, you should only list it once.
- Try to list claims in the order that they appear in the assistant’s response, so that related claims are grouped
together.
### Formatting
Your response should be a list of claims in the following JSON format:
‘‘‘json
[
    "fact_1",
    "fact_2",
...
]
‘‘‘

### Example
Below is an example of a prompt and response.

Prompt:
Who is Barack Obama?

Response:
Barack Obama is an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to
2017. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the first African American president in U.S. history.

Output:
‘‘‘json
[
    "Barack Obama is an American politician.",
    "Barack Obama is an attorney.",
    "Barack Obama served as the 44th President of the United States.",
    "Barack Obama served as president from 2009 to 2017.",
    "Barack Obama is a member of the Democratic Party.",
    "Barack Obama was the first African American president in United States history."
]
‘‘‘

Note that you should expect the assistant’s response to potentially be much longer than the one above, and could consist
of up to 100 separate claims.

### Task
Prompt:

""",
        "FACT_CHECKING": """### Introduction
Your task is to help fact-check an assistant’s response to a given prompt for factual correctness. You will be asked to
focus on a list of factual claims made by the assistant that represent a subset of factual claims made within the
assistant’s response. Your output will be used as part of the third step of the following fact-checking pipeline:

Fact-Checking Pipeline:
1. Given a prompt and assistant’s response, list all relevant factual claims made by the assistant.
2. Separate the list of N claims into M manageable groups.
3. For each group of claims, fact-check each claim in the group by browsing the web to find evidence supporting or
refuting the claim.

### Instructions
- You should fact-check the provided list of claims one by one.
- Please use your browser tool to confirm the factual correctness of each claim, which is extracted from the assistant’s
response to the provided prompt.
- You are expected to perform one or more web searches to find evidence supporting or refuting each claim. Limit yourself
to three web searches per claim.
- You are allowed to use evidence from a single source to support or refute multiple claims.
- Use this evidence to determine whether each claim is true or false.
- If you cannot confidently determine the correctness of a claim, e.g., if it is ambiguous or if the evidence is
inconclusive, then you should say that you are unsure.
- For each claim, provide supporting evidence for your answer in the form of a list of URLs, snippets, and summaries.
- Your response should be in the JSON format specified below.

### Connection of claims to the response
- Each claim is extracted from the assistant’s response, but it might be slightly rewritten from its exact phrasing in
the response.
- It is possible that an error was made in step 1 of the fact-checking pipeline, and one of the claims was not correctly
extracted from the response.
- Issues in a claim should not matter unless they are also reflected in the way this claim is phrased in the response.
- If you find evidence that contradicts a claim, but this evidence does not contradict the response, then the claim
should not be counted as a factual error.

### Formatting
Your response should be in the following JSON format (no comments):
‘‘‘json
[
    {{
        "claim": "<claim>",
        "answer": "true" | "false" | "unsure",
        "reasoning": "<Description of your decision for the factuality of claim. If your conclusion is \"false\", you
        should explain how the evidence contradicts both the claim as well as the response>",

            {{
            "url": "<link>",
            "snippet": "<relevant excerpt>",
