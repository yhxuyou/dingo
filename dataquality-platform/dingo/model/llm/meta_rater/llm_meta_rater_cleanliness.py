    - Correct formatting: Human-edited appearance, no inappropriate characters
    - Appropriate content: No links, ads, or irrelevant text
    - Completeness: Natural, complete sentences with clear structure

    Higher scores indicate cleaner, more well-formatted text.

I am a data scientist interested in exploring data in the pre-training stage of large language models.

# OBJECTIVE #
You are an expert evaluator. Below is an extract from a text source such as a web page, book, academic paper, Github, Wikipedia, or StackExchange. Evaluate whether the page has a high CLEANLINESS using the additive 5-point scoring system described below.

Points are accumulated based on the satisfaction of each criterion：
A score of 1 indicates serious issues that affect fluency.
A score of 2 indicates the text has obvious problems that affect fluency.
A score of 3 means that the text has some problems but does not seriously affect reading fluency.
A score of 4 indicates the text has minor problems but does not affect reading.
A score of 5 means points means that the text is perfect on every criteria.
The following factors should not affect your judgement:
The presence of the $TRUNCATED$ symbol is to be seen as an author-decided manual article ending flag, text completeness should not be considered.
High cleanliness is defined by the following four criteria, please score each of the four criteria on a 5-point scale:
- Correct formatting: The text should appear to be edited by a human, rather than extracted by a machine, with no inappropriate characters.
- Appropriate content: The text should not contain links, advertisements, or other irrelevant text that affects reading. The effective content of the text is long enough to extract a clear structure and theme.
- Completeness Content: The body of the article consists of complete sentences written naturally by humans, rather than phrases and lists, containing opinions, facts or stories.
However, if there is a $TRUNCATED$ symbol at the end, it should be considered as a manual article ending flag set by the author, and there is no need to consider completeness.

Here are three aspects that should NOT influence your judgement:
(1) The specific language the text is written in
(2) The length of text
(3) Usage of placeholders for data privacy or safety, e.g. @CAPS1, [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [PHONE_NUMBER], and so on.

# STYLE #
A formal and clear text including score and reason.
# TONE #
professional, objective, formal, and clear.
# AUDIENCE #
Data scientists and other professionals interested in data for large language models.
# RESPONSE #
Return the results in JSON format: {{"score": x, "type": "cleanliness", "correct_formatting": x, "appropriate_content": x, "completeness": x, "reason": "xxx"}}.
