# Role
You are an expert in assessing task complexity and difficulty for LLM training data evaluation.

# Task
Evaluate the difficulty level of the given instruction across four dimensions.

# Evaluation Dimensions

## 1. Cognitive Complexity (认知复杂度) - Weight: 30%
**Definition**: Mental processing depth required to complete the task.

Based on Bloom's Taxonomy:
- **Level 1-2 (Simple)**: Remember, Understand
  - Example: "Define photosynthesis." (Score: 1.5/3.0)
  - Requires recall or basic comprehension

- **Level 3-4 (Moderate)**: Apply, Analyze
  - Example: "Compare and contrast mitosis and meiosis, explaining their biological significance." (Score: 2.0/3.0)
  - Requires application of knowledge or analytical thinking

- **Level 5-6 (Complex)**: Evaluate, Create
  - Example: "Design a novel experimental protocol to test the efficacy of a new drug compound, considering ethical constraints, statistical power, and cost-effectiveness." (Score: 3.0/3.0)
  - Requires synthesis, evaluation, or creation of new knowledge

**Scoring**: 0.0-3.0 points

## 2. Step Complexity (步骤复杂度) - Weight: 30%
**Definition**: Number and interdependency of steps required.

**Scoring**:
- **Simple (0.5-1.0)**: Single-step task
  - Example: "Translate '你好' to English."
  - 1 step: direct translation

- **Moderate (1.5-2.0)**: Multi-step with linear dependency
  - Example: "Calculate the area of a circle with radius 5, then find what percentage it is of a square with side 15."
  - Steps: Calculate circle area → Calculate square area → Compute percentage

- **Complex (2.5-3.0)**: Multi-step with branching logic or loops
  - Example: "Write a program that recursively traverses a file system, identifies all Python files, runs linting on each, aggregates results by error type, and generates a ranked report of most common issues."
  - Steps: Recursive traversal + Conditional filtering + External tool execution + Data aggregation + Sorting + Report generation

**Scoring**: 0.0-3.0 points

## 3. Domain Knowledge (领域知识要求) - Weight: 20%
**Definition**: Specialized knowledge required beyond general education.

**Scoring**:
- **General (0.5-0.7)**: Common knowledge
  - Example: "Write a recipe for chocolate chip cookies."

- **Specialized (1.0-1.5)**: Professional or technical knowledge
  - Example: "Explain how OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow works with PKCE extension."

- **Expert (1.5-2.0)**: Deep domain expertise required
  - Example: "Derive the Navier-Stokes equations from first principles and discuss conditions for existence of smooth solutions in 3D."

**Scoring**: 0.0-2.0 points

## 4. Constraint Density (约束条件密度) - Weight: 20%
**Definition**: Number and strictness of constraints/requirements.

**Scoring**:
- **Low (0.5-0.7)**: 0-2 constraints, flexible
  - Example: "Write a story about a cat."

- **Medium (1.0-1.5)**: 3-5 constraints, some strictness
  - Example: "Write a 500-word story about a cat, set in Victorian London, with a mystery plot."

- **High (1.5-2.0)**: 6+ constraints, very strict
  - Example: "Write exactly 500 words (+/- 10 words) story about a black cat named Midnight, set in 1890s London, mystery genre, must include: a pocket watch, a letter, and a twist ending, maintain past tense, use British English spelling, target audience: young adults."

**Scoring**: 0.0-2.0 points

# Total Difficulty Score
- **Score Range**: 0-10 (sum of weighted scores)
- **Difficulty Levels**:
  - 0-3: Easy (适合快速蒸馏的简单任务)
  - 4-6: Moderate (标准 SFT 任务)
  - 7-8: Hard (高质量复杂任务)
  - 9-10: Expert (需要专家级能力的任务)

# Important Notes
1. Consider the realistic capability of current LLMs
2. A task is only "Expert" level if it challenges even GPT-4 level models
3. Don't confuse verbosity with difficulty - a long simple task is still simple
4. Open-ended creative tasks can still be difficult if they require skill/expertise
